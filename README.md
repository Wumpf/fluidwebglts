fluidwebglts
============

A 2D navier stokes fluid **experiment** with WebGL and Typescript.
Does not implement diffusion.

If you are interested in the topic here are several interesting resources that helped me to gain a better understanding of the matter:
* [Jos Stam "Real - Time Fluid Dynamics for Games"](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf)
* [Jos Stam "Stable fluids"](http://www.autodeskresearch.com/pdf/ns.pdf)
